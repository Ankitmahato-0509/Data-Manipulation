# Pandas Practice and Student Exam Analysis

A collection of pandas learning materials and a mini data project analyzing student study habits and exam performance.

***

## Overview

This repository focuses on:

* **Pandas Fundamentals**: Series, DataFrames, indexing, selection, cleaning, and transformations using real examples.[1]
* **Student Exam Score Analysis**: Exploring how study hours, sleep, attendance, and previous scores relate to exam scores using a structured CSV dataset.[2][1]

***

## Contents

## Main Notebook

### 1. Pandas.ipynb

* Practical pandas tutorial and practice notebook.[1]
* Covers:  
  * What pandas is, why it is useful, and how it differs from NumPy for tabular data.[1]
  * Core data structures: **Series** (1D labeled array) and **DataFrame** (2D labeled table).[1]
  * Creating Series and DataFrames, accessing `.values`, `.index`, and `.name`.[1]
  * Indexing methods: `[]`, `.loc`, `.iloc`, slicing, boolean filtering, and conditional selection.[1]
  * Handling missing data: `isnull`, `notnull`, `dropna`, `fillna` (with mean, forward fill, backward fill).[1]
  * Descriptive statistics with `describe`, `mean`, `std`, `min`, `max`, and quantiles.[1]
  * Column operations: creating new columns, `apply`, `lambda`, `replace`, and transforming values.[1]
  * Working with duplicates using `duplicated` and `drop_duplicates`.[1]
  * Grouping and combining data: `groupby`, `concat`, and `merge` for join-like operations.[1]
  * Exporting data: `to_csv` and `to_excel` to save cleaned or transformed DataFrames.[1]

## Data File

### 1. student_exam_scores.csv

* Dataset with 200 student records used for pandas practice and analysis.[2]
* Columns:  
  * `studentid`: Student identifier (e.g., S001, S002).[2]
  * `hoursstudied`: Daily study hours.[2]
  * `sleephours`: Daily sleep duration in hours.[2]
  * `attendancepercent`: Class attendance percentage.[2]
  * `previousscores`: Previous exam scores.[2]
  * `examscore`: Current exam score.[2]
* Suitable for exploring relationships between study habits, attendance, and performance using filtering, statistics, and visualizations.[2][1]

## Key Concepts

### Pandas Fundamentals

* Labeled data structures for heterogeneous tabular data (numbers, strings, and dates).[1]
* Flexible indexing with `.loc` (label-based) and `.iloc` (position-based).[1]
* Powerful data cleaning tools for handling missing values and inconsistent entries.[1]

### Student Exam Analysis

* Importing CSV data into DataFrames with `pd.read_csv`.[2][1]
* Using `head`, `tail`, and `info` to understand structure, types, and memory usage.[1]
* Generating statistical summaries with `describe` to inspect distributions of study hours, attendance, and exam scores.[2][1]
* Filtering records based on conditions like high attendance, high previous scores, or high exam scores.[1]
* Sorting and grouping to explore patterns across different ranges of attendance or performance.[1]

## Usage Examples

### Loading the Exam Scores Dataset

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("student_exam_scores.csv")

print(df.head())          # First 5 rows
print(df.info())          # Structure and data types
print(df.describe())      # Statistical summary
```

### Filtering High-Performing Students

```python
# Students with attendance >= 80 and exam score >= 40
high_perf = df[(df["attendancepercent"] >= 80) & (df["examscore"] >= 40)]
print(high_perf.head())
```

### Handling Missing Values

```python
# Drop rows where all values are missing
df_clean = df.dropna(how="all")

# Fill missing exam scores with the mean exam score
df["examscore"] = df["examscore"].fillna(df["examscore"].mean())
```

## Learning Outcomes

After working through this repository, you will be able to:

* Understand and apply **core pandas operations** on Series and DataFrames.[1]
* Load, inspect, clean, and transform CSV datasets.[2][1]
* Use boolean filtering and conditional logic to answer questions from tabular data.[1]
* Compute descriptive statistics to interpret study and performance patterns among students.[2][1]
